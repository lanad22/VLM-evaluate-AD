    "Strengths": "The audio descriptions were well-written, and the track placement is very good. The descriptions of visual details of David's actions and expressions add context and humor to the video for someone who can't see it. The extended description at the beginning sets the scene perfectly. I especially appreciated the description of David shaking his head around while stating he can not see anything, as well as David lifting his head and asking questions while putting both hands in the air. These were very well done. The descriptions fit well in natural pauses in the dialogue. The extended audio descriptions were used effectively.",
    "Areas for improvement": "The descriptions could be more concise in some instances. For example, instead of \"David sits up from his seat, pointing two fingers in the air,\" a shorter description like \"David sits up, pointing two fingers up\" would be just as effective.  Similarly, \"David gets his right index finger and points it towards his teeth asking his father questions\" could be shortened to \"David points at his teeth.\""
