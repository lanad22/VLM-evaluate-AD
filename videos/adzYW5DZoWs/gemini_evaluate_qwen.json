    "evaluation_summary": {
        "overall_quality_rating": "3",
        "strengths": "The audio description captures most of the significant visual elements, including on-screen text, key character actions, and important scene changes.  The descriptions are generally concise and well-written.",
        "areas_for_improvement": "There are opportunities to enhance the AD by including more detailed descriptions of character expressions, emotions, and some of the more nuanced visual details. The timing of some descriptions could be adjusted to better align with the visuals and avoid overlapping dialogue.  A more comprehensive description of the golden medallion would be beneficial, perhaps mentioning its size, shape, and specific details.  Lastly, the pacing feels a bit rushed in places; slowing down the narration slightly would improve clarity and comprehension."

    "criteria_ratings": {
        "reads_text_on_screen": {
            "rating": "4",
            "justification": "All text on screen is read accurately.  Timing is good, though it could be slightly improved in a couple of instances by starting the audio description a fraction of a second earlier."
        },
        "inline_track_quality": {
            "rating": "3",
            "justification": "Inline descriptions are mostly effective, but some crucial visual details are missed, such as Rey's facial expressions and emotions during critical moments. More descriptive language could be used to convey the intensity of certain scenes. For example, when Rey ignites the lightsaber, more evocative language could be used to describe the sound and visual effect."
        },
        "extended_track_quality": {
            "rating": "3",
            "justification": "The extended descriptions provide a good overview of the scenes, but they lack depth in some areas. Specifically, the description of the final scene with the wreckage in the sea could be more detailed, mentioning the scale of the wreckage and the condition of the sea. The emotional impact of the scene is not fully conveyed through the audio description."
        },
        "balance_of_inline_and_extended": {
            "rating": "3",
            "justification": "The balance between inline and extended descriptions is adequate, but there's a slight over-reliance on shorter descriptions.  Some scenes, like the one with Kylo Ren, could benefit from a more extended description to better capture the atmosphere and action."
        },
        "track_placement": {
            "rating": "4",
            "justification": "The placement of the audio description track is generally good, with minimal overlap with dialogue.  However, there are a few instances where the timing could be refined to avoid competing with the music or sound effects."
