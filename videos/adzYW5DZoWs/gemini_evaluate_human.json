        "balance_of_inline_and_extended": {
            "justification": "As noted above, the reliance solely on inline descriptions limits the depth of information conveyed, particularly during action sequences. A more effective balance could be achieved by incorporating extended descriptions during scenes like Ray's fight with the TIE Interceptor or Kylo Ren's lightsaber duel to fully describe the intricate movements and visual effects.",
            "rating": "3"
        },
        "extended_track_quality": {
            "justification": "The current audio description primarily relies on inline descriptions.  There are no extended descriptions utilized in this trailer. Given the fast-paced nature of some scenes, introducing extended descriptions could improve the overall quality and provide a more immersive experience for the visually impaired audience.",
            "rating": "N/A"
        },
        "inline_track_quality": {
            "justification": "While most inline descriptions adequately convey the basic visual information, there's room for improvement in terms of detail and richness. For example, the description \"Ray stands alone in the middle of a sandy desert, staring into the distance\" at 10.65s could be enhanced by mentioning the time of day (e.g., \"under the scorching midday sun\") or adding a detail about Ray's facial expression (e.g., \"her face etched with determination\").  The description of Ray’s lightsaber at 21.52s could have included details about its shape, color, or sounds. Also, at 29.21s, identifying the type of vehicle (X-Wing) would have been helpful. At 54.76s, specifying “blue” lightsaber is preferred.",

        "reads_text_on_screen": {
            "justification": "All instances of on-screen text are read accurately and promptly. For example, the \"Lucasfilm Ltd.\" logo at the beginning, the intertitle cards like \"Every generation has a legend\", \"This Christmas\", and \"The saga comes to an end\", and the final title card \"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\" are all described clearly.  The supplemental text at the bottom of the last title card, “THIS FILM IS NOT YET RATED” etc., was also read. There is no unnecessary repetition or mispronunciation.",

        },
        "track_placement": {
            "justification": "The placement of the AD track is generally good, with descriptions typically starting shortly after the visuals appear on screen. However, some descriptions start slightly late, such as the description of Ray in the desert at ~10.7s starting after she breathes in audibly at 10.6s, or the description of the vehicle approaching at 29.21s only beginning after the vehicle is clearly visible and has been in view for several seconds (28.8s). While these delays are not significant enough to cause major comprehension issues, improving the timing could provide a smoother and more synchronized viewing experience.",

        }
    },
    "evaluation_summary": {
        "areas_for_improvement": "There are several instances where the inline descriptions could be more detailed and evocative. Some descriptions are a bit too literal or lack sufficient context, failing to fully convey the mood, atmosphere, and character emotions portrayed visually. The balance between inline and extended descriptions could also be improved, as some scenes with fast-paced action might benefit from more extended descriptions to provide greater detail without rushing the narration. Some descriptions also start slightly late, though not critically so.",
        "overall_quality_rating": "3",
        "strengths": "The audio description track effectively covers most of the important visual information within the video, ensuring that viewers who are blind or have low vision can follow the plot and understand the on-screen action. The descriptions of on-screen text are accurate and well-timed. The voiceover artist delivers the descriptions clearly and with appropriate pacing."
