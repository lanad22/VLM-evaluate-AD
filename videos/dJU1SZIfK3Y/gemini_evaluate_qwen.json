    "evaluation_summary": {
        "overall_quality_rating": "3",
        "strengths": "The audio description does a decent job of capturing the main dialogue and some visual elements, making the video somewhat accessible.",
        "areas_for_improvement": "The AD significantly lacks detail in visual descriptions. Key elements like facial expressions, actions, and scene transitions are often missed. The on-screen text from the source website isn't fully captured, which impacts context and navigation for visually impaired users. Additionally, the AD track's timing could be improved to better synchronize with the visuals and avoid overlapping dialogue."

    "criteria_ratings": {
        "Reads Text-on-Screen": {
            "rating": "2",
            "justification": "The AD inconsistently captures on-screen text. While 'MOVIECLIPS.COM' is mentioned, other crucial text like actor/director names, genre information, and interactive elements on the website are omitted. This incompleteness hinders a visually impaired user's understanding of the context and ability to navigate the source material."
        },
        "Inline Track Quality": {
            "rating": "3",
            "justification": "The shorter inline descriptions, such as \"Buddy peeks, listens, hides\" and \"Buddy confused, turns to orange elf\", are generally effective and well-placed within natural pauses. However, there's room for more descriptive language to enhance the visual experience for the audience."
        },
        "Extended Track Quality": {
            "rating": "3",
            "justification": "The extended descriptions provide some visual context, but often lack detail. For instance, descriptions of the elves' outfits, the workshop environment, and Buddy's reactions could be more comprehensive.  More detailed descriptions would better convey the scene's atmosphere and characters' emotions."
        },
        "strategic_AD_type_selection": {
            "rating": "3",
            "justification": "The mix of inline and extended AD is acceptable, but not always strategically optimal. Some extended descriptions could be condensed into inline descriptions without losing essential information. This would create a more seamless viewing experience."
        },
        "track_placement": {
            "rating": "4",
            "justification": "The AD track mostly avoids overlapping with dialogue and music. However, there are a few instances where the timing could be adjusted slightly for better clarity and flow."
